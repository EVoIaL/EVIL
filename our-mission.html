        <p>
            The mission of Ethical Vanguards of Integrity and Liberty (EVIL) is to uphold and promote the
            human rights, dignity, and individual freedoms of those who cannot advocate for themselves. We are
            committed to making a difference in the lives of the elderly, infants, and disabled by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collaborating with experts in science and psychology to ensure the well-being of those we support</li>
            <li>Creating awareness and educating the public about the challenges faced by these vulnerable groups</li>
            <li>Engaging with policymakers and advocating for laws that protect their rights and promote their interests</li>
            <li>Empowering families and caregivers with the resources and tools they need to provide the best possible care</li>
            <li>Building partnerships with like-minded organizations to amplify our impact and reach</li>
        </ul>
